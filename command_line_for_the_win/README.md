Command line for the win project

The challenge is about testing our skills on bash. This project also helps us demonstrate the use of SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.


How I moved the jpeg from my local machine to remote server.
0. I navigated to where the jpeg was on my local machine and that was on my Desktop.
1. I took the SFTP server address from my sandbox and copied it to my local machine terminal.
2. It requested for password and that was also taken from my sandbox.
3. Then I used the word 'get' (get ./<jpeg picture name> .)
	for better understanding './' means my current directory and '.' means to the current directory I am in my remote server.
With this step, the file was uploaded to my remote server.
4. I moved the file i.e jpeg to the directory (alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win) requested of me by ALX.
5. Finally, I pushed to github.
